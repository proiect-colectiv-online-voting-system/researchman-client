The client-side part of the ResearchMan application.

# How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install node.js 12.14 if you haven't already
3. In the foler where you cloned the repo, install `http-server`. This will serve the HTML pages to the client: `npm i http-server`
4. Run `npx http-server -c-c1 ./`

At this point the front-end should be ready to use. To set up the back end see the https://github.com/proiect-colectiv-online-voting-system/researchman-server
